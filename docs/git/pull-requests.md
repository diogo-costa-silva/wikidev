# Pull Requests

> **PR workflow and collaboration for effective code review and team development.**

Pull Requests (PRs) are the cornerstone of collaborative software development. They enable code review, knowledge sharing, and maintain code quality while allowing multiple developers to work together effectively.

## üéØ Goals

- **Master PR workflow** from creation to merge
- **Write effective PRs** that get reviewed quickly
- **Conduct quality code reviews** that improve the codebase
- **Handle feedback and iterations** professionally

## üîç Quick Verification

Test the PR workflow:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/test-pr

# Make a small change
echo "# Test PR" > test-pr.md
git add test-pr.md
git commit -m "Add test PR documentation"

# Push branch
git push origin feature/test-pr

# Create PR using GitHub CLI (if available)
gh pr create --title "Test PR workflow" --body "Testing the PR creation process"

# Check PR status
gh pr status
```

## üöÄ Creating Effective Pull Requests

### PR Preparation Checklist
```bash
# Before creating a PR, ensure:
# 1. Code is working and tested
git status                           # Clean working directory
npm test                            # All tests pass (if applicable)
npm run lint                        # Code follows style guidelines

# 2. Branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main                      # Or rebase: git rebase main

# 3. Commits are clean
git log --oneline -10               # Review commit history
# Consider squashing if needed: git rebase -i HEAD~3

# 4. Code is pushed
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Creating PRs with GitHub CLI
```bash
# Basic PR creation
gh pr create --title "Add user authentication" \
             --body "Implements JWT-based authentication system"

# PR with template and labels
gh pr create --title "feat: add user profiles" \
             --body "$(cat .github/pull_request_template.md)" \
             --label "feature" \
             --label "frontend" \
             --assignee "@me"

# Draft PR (for work in progress)
gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: refactor database layer" \
             --body "Work in progress - not ready for review"

# PR to specific branch
gh pr create --base develop --head feature/my-feature \
             --title "Feature for develop branch"
```

## üîÑ PR Workflow Patterns

### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard

# 2. Develop feature with small, focused commits
git add components/Dashboard.js
git commit -m "Add dashboard component structure"

git add api/dashboard.js
git commit -m "Add dashboard API endpoints"

git add tests/dashboard.test.js
git commit -m "Add dashboard component tests"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-dashboard
gh pr create --title "feat: add user dashboard" \
             --body "Implements responsive user dashboard with real-time data"

# 4. Iterate based on feedback
# (make changes, commit, push)

# 5. Merge when approved
gh pr merge 123 --merge  # Or --squash or --rebase
```

### Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix from main/master
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch

# 2. Make minimal fix
git add security/auth.js
git commit -m "hotfix: patch XSS vulnerability in auth"

# 3. Create urgent PR
gh pr create --title "HOTFIX: Security patch for auth" \
             --body "Critical security fix - please review ASAP" \
             --label "hotfix" \
             --label "security"

# 4. Fast-track review and merge
# 5. Deploy immediately
```

### Documentation Updates
```bash
# Simple documentation PRs
git checkout -b docs/api-examples
git add docs/api.md
git commit -m "docs: add API usage examples"
git push origin docs/api-examples

gh pr create --title "docs: improve API documentation" \
             --body "Adds clear examples and error handling guidance"
```

## üìä PR Analytics and Management

### Tracking PR Status
```bash
# View PR status
gh pr status

# List all PRs
gh pr list --state open
gh pr list --author "@me"
gh pr list --label "bug"

# PR details
gh pr view 123
gh pr checks 123                    # View CI status
gh pr diff 123                      # View changes
```

### PR Metrics
```bash
# Time tracking (example commands)
gh pr list --json createdAt,mergedAt,number | jq '
  .[] | 
  select(.mergedAt != null) |
  {
    pr: .number,
    days_open: ((now - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)) / 86400 | floor)
  }
'
```

## üí° Team Collaboration Tips

### Code Review Culture
```markdown
## Effective Review Comments

### Good Examples:
‚úÖ "Consider extracting this logic into a utility function for reusability"
‚úÖ "This looks great! One small suggestion: we could use Array.includes() for better readability"
‚úÖ "Security concern: this input should be validated before use"

### Avoid:
‚ùå "This is wrong" (not constructive)
‚ùå "Why did you do it this way?" (sounds confrontational)
‚ùå "Fix this" (no explanation)

### Better Alternatives:
‚úÖ "This approach might cause issues with X. Consider Y instead because..."
‚úÖ "Help me understand the reasoning behind this approach"
‚úÖ "This could be improved by..."
```

### PR Size Guidelines
```bash
# Ideal PR sizes
echo "Small PRs (< 200 lines): ‚úÖ Quick to review, easy to understand"
echo "Medium PRs (200-500 lines): ‚ö†Ô∏è Still manageable with good description"
echo "Large PRs (> 500 lines): ‚ùå Consider splitting into smaller PRs"

# Check PR size
gh pr diff 123 --name-only | wc -l  # Files changed
gh pr diff 123 | grep -E "^[+-]" | wc -l  # Lines changed
```

gh pr checkout 123                  # Checkout PR locally
gh pr diff 123                      # View PR changes
gh pr merge 123                     # Merge PR
```

**Code Review:**
```bash
gh pr review 123 --approve         # Approve PR
