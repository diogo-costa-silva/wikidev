# ChatGPT

ChatGPT is OpenAI's conversational AI assistant that excels at natural language processing, code generation, and problem-solving. It's accessible through web interface, API, and mobile apps.

## Quick Start

**Web Access:**
```bash
# Open ChatGPT in browser
open "https://chat.openai.com"
```

**Verify Access:**
```bash
# Test with a simple prompt
# "Write a Python function to calculate factorial"
```

## Key Features

### Code Generation & Review
- Generate code in multiple languages
- Debug and optimize existing code
- Explain complex algorithms
- Code reviews and suggestions

### Documentation & Writing
- Technical documentation
- README files and comments
- API documentation
- Markdown formatting

### Problem Solving
- Algorithm design
- System architecture discussions
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Best practices recommendations

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting
```markdown
# Good prompt structure:
1. Context: "I'm working on a Python web scraper"
2. Task: "I need to parse JSON from an API"
3. Constraints: "Handle rate limiting and errors"
4. Format: "Show me the code with comments"
```

### Code Generation Tips
- Specify language and version
- Include error handling requirements
- Request documentation/comments
- Ask for test cases when needed

### Security Considerations
- Never share API keys or secrets
- Avoid sharing sensitive business logic
- Review generated code before use
- Be cautious with database queries

## Common Use Cases

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Typical ChatGPT integration in development:
# 1. Design discussion
# 2. Code generation
# 3. Code review
# 4. Documentation writing
# 5. Testing strategies
```

### Learning & Research
- Explain new technologies
- Compare frameworks/libraries
- Understand error messages
- Learn design patterns

## Integration Options

### Browser Extension
- Quick access from any webpage
- Code snippet generation
- Documentation lookup

### API Access
```python
# OpenAI API for programmatic access
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="your-key-here")
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

### Mobile Apps
- iOS and Android apps available
- Voice input support
- Conversation sync across devices

## Limitations & Considerations
