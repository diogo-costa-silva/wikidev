## üöÄ Core Features

### Conversational Development

**Architectural Planning:**
```
You: I'm building a e-commerce platform. Help me design the system architecture.

Claude: I'd be happy to help design your e-commerce architecture. Let me ask a few key questions first:

1. Expected scale (users, orders per day)?
2. Key features needed (payments, inventory, recommendations)?
3. Technology preferences or constraints?
4. Team size and expertise level?

Based on your answers, I can propose a scalable architecture with specific technology choices and deployment strategies.
```

**Problem-Solving Discussions:**
```
You: My microservices are experiencing high latency. Here's my current architecture [upload diagram].

Claude: [Analyzes the uploaded diagram] I can see several potential bottlenecks in your current setup:

1. **Service mesh overhead** - You have 12 services all communicating through Istio
2. **Database design** - Multiple services sharing the same database
3. **Network topology** - Services are making too many cross-region calls

Let me suggest a step-by-step optimization approach...
```

### Visual Content Analysis

**Code Screenshots:**
- Upload screenshots of IDE errors
- Get explanations of complex debugging sessions
- Analyze code snippets from documentation

**Architecture Diagrams:**
- Upload system architecture diagrams for review
- Get suggestions for improvements
- Discuss trade-offs of different approaches

**UI/UX Mockups:**
- Share design mockups for technical feasibility analysis
- Discuss implementation approaches
- Get responsive design suggestions

### Document Analysis

**Upload and Analyze:**
- API documentation for integration planning
- Requirements documents for technical analysis
- Code files for comprehensive review
- Log files for debugging assistance

## üìã Common Workflows

### 1. Project Planning Workflow

**Initial Discussion:**
```
You: I need to build a real-time chat application. What should I consider?

Claude: Great project! Real-time chat has several key considerations:

**Core Requirements Analysis:**
- User authentication and presence
- Message persistence and history  
- Real-time delivery (WebSocket/SSE)
- Scalability for concurrent users
- Media sharing capabilities

**Technical Stack Decisions:**
- Backend: Node.js + Socket.io vs Python + FastAPI + WebSockets
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis for sessions
- Frontend: React/Vue with WebSocket client
- Infrastructure: Load balancers, message queues

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas? Also, what's your target user base and performance requirements?
```

**Deep Dive Planning:**
```
You: Let's focus on the backend architecture. I expect 10,000 concurrent users.

Claude: For 10K concurrent users, here's a scalable backend architecture:

**Core Architecture:**
```

### 2. Code Review Workflow

**Upload Multiple Files:**
1. Upload your main application files
2. Include configuration and dependency files
3. Add test files if available

**Comprehensive Analysis:**
```
You: [Uploads 5 Python files] Please review this Flask API for security and performance issues.

Claude: I've analyzed all your uploaded files. Here's my comprehensive review:

**Security Issues Found:**
1. **SQL Injection Risk** (models.py, line 34)
   - Raw SQL query without parameterization
   - Recommendation: Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries

2. **Missing Authentication** (routes.py)
   - Sensitive endpoints lack authentication
   - Recommendation: Implement JWT or session-based auth

**Performance Issues:**
1. **N+1 Query Problem** (user_service.py, line 67)
   - Loading user posts individually in a loop
   - Recommendation: Use eager loading with joins

[Continues with detailed analysis...]
```

### 3. Debugging Workflow

**Error Investigation:**
```
You: [Uploads error logs] My application keeps crashing with this error. Can you help?

Claude: Looking at your error logs, I can see the issue:

**Root Cause:** Memory leak in the user session handler
- Line 156: Session objects not being properly cleaned up
- Growing memory usage over time until OOM crash

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check memory usage patterns with `ps aux | grep python`
2. Use memory profiler: `pip install memory-profiler`
3. Add proper session cleanup in finally blocks

**Immediate Fix:**
[Provides specific code changes]

**Long-term Prevention:**
[Suggests monitoring and testing strategies]
```

### 4. Learning & Documentation

**Technology Research:**
```
You: I'm new to GraphQL. Can you explain how it compares to REST and when to use it?

Claude: Great question! Let me break down GraphQL vs REST:

**REST Characteristics:**
- Multiple endpoints for different resources
- Fixed response structure
- HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Simple caching with HTTP headers

**GraphQL Characteristics:**
- Single endpoint for all operations
- Flexible, client-specified response structure  
- Query language for data fetching
- Built-in introspection and type system

**When to Choose GraphQL:**
‚úÖ Complex data relationships
‚úÖ Mobile apps needing efficient data loading
‚úÖ Rapid frontend development with changing requirements
‚úÖ Strong typing requirements

**When to Choose REST:**
‚úÖ Simple CRUD operations
‚úÖ Heavy caching requirements
‚úÖ File uploads/downloads
‚úÖ Existing REST expertise on team

Would you like me to show you a practical example of building the same API with both approaches?
```

## üîó Integration with Development Tools

### VS Code Integration

While Claude Desktop doesn't integrate directly with VS Code, you can create efficient workflows:

1. **Screenshot sharing** - Capture VS Code errors and share for analysis
2. **File export** - Copy code from VS Code and paste into conversations
3. **Side-by-side workflow** - Keep Claude Desktop open alongside your IDE

### Git Workflow Integration

```
You: [Uploads git diff] Should I merge this feature branch? Any issues you can spot?

Claude: Looking at your diff, I can see this adds user authentication. Here's my analysis:

**Changes Look Good:**
‚úÖ Proper password hashing with bcrypt
‚úÖ JWT token implementation  
‚úÖ Input validation on all endpoints
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling

**Concerns:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing rate limiting on login endpoint
‚ö†Ô∏è No password complexity requirements
‚ö†Ô∏è JWT secret should be environment variable

**Pre-merge Checklist:**
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Update password validation rules  
- [ ] Move JWT_SECRET to environment config
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases
- [ ] Update API documentation

Would you like me to help with any of these improvements?
```

### Documentation Generation

```
You: [Uploads API code files] Generate comprehensive API documentation for these endpoints.

Claude: I'll create comprehensive API documentation based on your code:

# User Authentication API

## Overview
This API provides user registration, authentication, and profile management functionality.

## Base URL
`https://api.yourapp.com/v1`

## Authentication
All authenticated endpoints require a Bearer token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## Endpoints

### POST /auth/register
**Description:** Register a new user account

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "string (required, 3-50 chars)",
  "email": "string (required, valid email)",
  "password": "string (required, min 8 chars)"
}
```
